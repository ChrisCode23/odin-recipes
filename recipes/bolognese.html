    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This North Italian recipe comes from Bologna, Italy. One unusual characteristic of this Bolognese sauce is that it has no garlic — but there is a hint of ground nutmeg. Serve over hot, cooked pasta.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ounces pancetta, diced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>12 ounces lean ground pork</li>
        <li>¼ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup white wine</li>
        <li>2 cups beef stock</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>½ pound chicken liver</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add onion, carrot, celery, and pancetta; cook, stirring often, until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a heavy large saucepan.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Cook and stir ground pork and beef in hot oil until crumbly and browned. Pour in wine, increase heat to medium-high, and boil briskly, stirring constantly, until almost all of the liquid has evaporated. Transfer ground meat mixture to the saucepan with pancetta and vegetables. Set the skillet aside.</li>
        <li>Stir beef stock and tomato paste into the saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté chicken livers in hot butter until firm and lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove livers from the skillet and dice. Set aside and add to sauce 10 minutes before it is done.</li>
        <li>A few minutes before serving, stir in cream and cook until sauce is heated through. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.</li>
    </ol>
